Product Requirements Document: Real-Time Multilingual Meeting Assistant
1. Executive Summary
Product Vision
A desktop application that provides seamless real-time transcription and contextual translation during bilingual meetings, enabling natural conversation flow between speakers of two different languages.
Problem Statement
Global business meetings frequently involve participants who speak different primary languages, creating communication barriers that:

Reduce meeting effectiveness and participant engagement
Require expensive human interpreters or disruptive translation tools
Lead to misunderstandings due to lack of immediate, contextual translation
Create delays in decision-making and collaboration

Solution Overview
A desktop application that captures live audio, displays real-time transcription of the speaker's words, and provides contextual translation in the alternate language upon sentence completion. The solution leverages Google Gemini API for accuracy and low latency while maintaining cost-effectiveness.
Core Value Proposition
Transform bilingual meetings into seamless conversations by providing instant, contextually-aware translation that preserves the natural flow of discussion without interrupting speakers or requiring manual intervention.
